I am a doctoral candidate at the College of Intelligence and Computing of Tianjin University, under the supervision of Dr. Qinghua Hu and Dr.
Pengfei Zhu. At present, I am working towards my doctoral thesis focusing on open set recognition. Beyond this thesis, I have broad interests in computer vision, pattern recognition, and AI for science, particularly being concerned with machine learning applications in life science.
